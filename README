Introduction
-

This project exists for two reasons: firstly, to provide something
to look at for anyone who wants to put together a more advanced
client; secondly as a consolation prize to a member of my gaming
group, who holds BitchX and NetHack as the twin pinnacles of
software development. This was, basically, the only way I'd get
him to use Phyre.

Stuff included
-

In addition to the main source file (longbow.cs), you should have:

build.sh   - Uses mkbundle to create a self-executable of Longbow-CLI
             which doesn't require Mono. Will screw with your environ
             -ment variables, read the script first to be sure.

compile.sh - Compiles Longbow to a standard Mono .exe. Also integrates
	     the build number in longbow.vr.

longbow.vr - Contains the build number. 

package.sh - Calls build.sh, then packs the resulting executable and
	     and longbow.vr into a .zip for distribution.

Usage
-

Run longbow (or mono longbow.exe) from console. Optionally, supply
your username as the first argument in order to skip needing to
type it at login.

If you run into any problems (you will) please report your bugs at
tracker.sudowned.com as soon as possible.
